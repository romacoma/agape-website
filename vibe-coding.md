## Vibe Coding

Vibe Coding is a modern development approach where you shift from writing code manually to orchestrating a team of AI agents that write code, test, and design for you. The core idea is to "go with the vibe" and focus on outcomes, delegating routine work to neural networks.

## ⚡ Coding Rules (CRITICAL)

* NEVER use regex for HTML manipulation
* DO NOT use `-replace` for large or multi-line HTML
* ALWAYS use `IndexOf` + `Substring` for replacing blocks
* Avoid `.*` and `.*?` patterns (they cause freezing)
* Code must be fast and safe for large files

If regex is used — rewrite the solution.




You are working on Windows but must behave like a Linux environment.
Use bash syntax only.
Paths must use /c/Users/... format.
Do not use PowerShell commands.


## 🔑 Core Principles

* **Golden Rule: The quality of your specification defines the result.** The quality of generated code directly depends on how clearly the task is defined. Your prompt must include: **role, goal, and context.**
* **Role shift: From implementer to architect.** Now ~30% of your time goes to interacting with AI, and ~70% to user experience and business logic. The developer becomes a controller: decomposes tasks and reviews the "worker's" (AI's) output.
* **Modular architecture = speed.** Use **feature-based architecture** (structure by features). If your project turns into a "monolith" (huge files), AI wastes tokens just to understand context, makes more mistakes, and becomes slower.
* **One chat = one task.** To avoid hallucinations and context overflow, solve each code block in a separate chat.
* **Do not mix design, backend, and deployment in one conversation.**

## 🧱 Recommended Tech Stack

For vibe coding, it's critical to choose **popular, battle-tested tools**, since AI is trained on millions of examples from these ecosystems.

### For simpler scenarios:
* **HTML** — page structure, block layout, semantics.
* **CSS** — styling, responsiveness, animations (including utility classes like Tailwind).
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** — interactivity, animations, AJAX, REST API integration.
* **PHP** — WordPress core, themes, plugins, business logic.
* **SQL / MySQL** — basic queries (SELECT / UPDATE, JOIN) for custom features.

### For more advanced setups:
* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (AI handles typed code better and makes fewer mistakes).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (must-have). Allows AI to generate styles directly in markup.
* **State management:** Zustand (simpler than Redux, less boilerplate).
* **Backend & DB:** NestJS + Prisma (clear structure that AI understands well).
* **Hosting:** Railway (simple deploy & automation) or Hetzner.

## 🛠️ Tools & Infrastructure

* **Antigravity (app + model):** Convenient, fast, all-in-one tool with Gemini Pro subscription.
* **Context files:** Create `gemini.md`, `claude.md`, or `agents.md` from day one. These files act as **project memory**: rules, stack, current progress.
* **Skills:** Use industry-recognized best-practice skills. Create custom instructions for repetitive tasks.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** A layer for complex pipelines and automations. It allows AI to connect to databases, GitHub, logs (Sentry), and browser automation.

## 🔐 Security & Quality Control

* **Never blindly trust AI:** Models can hallucinate. Always ask AI to review its own code for technical debt and mistakes.
* **Token allocation:** Use powerful models (Gemini 1.5 Pro) for planning; lighter models (Flash) for edits and testing.
* **Security:** Use private GitHub repositories only. Store keys in `.env` files and never expose them publicly.
* **Backups:** Regular backups are mandatory. AI can accidentally squash commit history or delete files.
